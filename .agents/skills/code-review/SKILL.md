name: code-review
description: Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along three axes — Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?), Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/PRD asked for?), and Simplifications (is there evidence-backed surface to remove, fold, or demote?). Runs all reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to "review since X".
---

Three-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards** — does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** — does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / PRD / spec?
- **Simplifications** — does the changed surface contain evidence-backed opportunities to delete, fold, deduplicate, or demote code without losing intended behavior?

All three axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you — run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point — a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc. If they didn't specify one, ask for it.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here — not inside two parallel sub-agents.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.) — fetch via the workflow in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A PRD/spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below — a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation — and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads _what it is_ → _how to fix_; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Prepare the simplification survey

The **Simplifications** axis is an evidence-backed survey of the diff and the nearby consumers, not a request to redesign the feature. Start with the largest production-code deltas and inspect their call sites and data flow. Use `rg` (exact symbols, event names, config keys, package names, method names, and wire strings) before judging a surface.

For each possible candidate, classify consumers as:

- **Production** — runtime source, loaders/config paths, scripts, and examples that are actual product or smoke paths.
- **Non-production** — tests, docs, Agent Notes, snapshots, generated expected outputs, and comments.
- **Ambiguous** — examples or support scripts whose role needs inspection.

Look specifically for dead or test/docs-only surfaces, duplicated representations or lifecycle machinery, speculative generality, over-built defensive code, and hand-rolled code that a maintained dependency or Node builtin could replace. Require call-site and diff evidence; a name that merely looks unused or code that merely looks complex is not enough. Honor documented repo standards and intentional architectural seams (for example, deliberate adapters, backends, or compatibility boundaries); do not recommend collapsing one solely because it resembles another. Report only strong candidates with a concrete deletion, folding, deduplication, demotion, or rehome proposal, the net simplification, and risks such as public API or behavior changes, future product needs, and residual semantics. Reject or downgrade thin candidates and ordinary feature decisions.

### 5. Spawn all three sub-agents in parallel

Send a single message with three `Agent` tool calls. Use the `general-purpose` subagent for all three.

**Standards sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full — the sub-agent has no other access to it.
- The brief: "Report — per file/hunk where relevant — (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls — documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

**Simplifications sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The relevant standards, architecture, and intentional-seam source files identified while preparing the survey, plus the spec path or fetched contents when available.
- The brief: "Survey the changed surfaces and nearby consumers. Identify only evidence-backed simplification candidates: dead or test/docs-only, duplicated, speculative, over-built, or hand-rolled-where-a-maintained-dependency-or-Node-builtin-suffices. For every candidate, classify the consumers as production, non-production, or ambiguous; cite the relevant files, symbols, and call sites; propose exact deletion, folding, deduplication, demotion, or rehome; state the net simplification and risks (public API, behavior, future product needs, and residual semantics). Honor documented repo standards and intentional seams; do not flag a deliberate adapter/backend/compatibility boundary solely for duplication. Say what you checked and why weak candidates were rejected. Under 400 words."

### 6. Aggregate

Present the three reports under `## Standards`, `## Spec`, and `## Simplifications` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings — the three axes are deliberately separate (see _Why three axes_). If the spec is missing, retain the note that the Spec sub-agent was skipped.

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). For Simplifications, count strong candidates and name the highest-confidence candidate (if any). Don't pick a single winner across axes — that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

## Why three axes

A change can pass one axis and fail another:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**
- Code that is correct and convention-compliant but leaves dead, duplicated, speculative, or hand-rolled surface → **Standards pass, Spec pass, Simplifications still has a candidate.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the others; a simplification candidate is not automatically a standards or spec failure.
